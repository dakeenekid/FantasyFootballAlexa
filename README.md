As a fantasy football freak myself, nothing makes me more upset when I start the wrong player, and my bench suddenly does much better than my starting lineup. With Fantasy Pick or Sit, you can ask which player (between two players) is a more worthy start, and you'll hear what percentage of fantasy experts recommend starting one over the other. To use, simply enable the skill on your device and say "Alexa, ask fantasy pick or sit to choose between (player 1) and (player 2)".
